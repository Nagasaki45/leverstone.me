My main language is python.
I use it regularly for web development, data analysis, and other bits and bobs.
I like elixir for highly concurrent webapps.
Frontend-wise I will usually go for react / next.js with typescript, or plain old HTML/CSS/JS.
I'm familiar with way too many creative coding languages: max/MSP and Pd, arduino and processing, some unity3d, blender and a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Hobbies"></category></entry><entry><title>Music</title><link href="/hobbies/music" rel="alternate"></link><published>2025-01-03T17:08:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-01-03T17:08:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Tom Leverstone</name></author><id>tag:None,2025-01-03:/hobbies/music</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I play an instrument since... forever!

Started with sax and piano as a kid. Picked up bass guitar at 14 and played in a few rock bands since then.
Got into electronic music in 2017 and shortly after started performing improvised modular jams under the alias &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://nagasaki45.leverstone.me"&gt;nagasaki45&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

Recently got into cycling, and especially bikepacking.
Always try to escape the city on the weekends for a night in the tent and some scenic rides.

Get my saw and chisels out and do some carpentry when I need new furniture.
Also, design and build some simple modules for my synth.
You see, my hobbies feed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Hobbies"></category></entry></feed>
