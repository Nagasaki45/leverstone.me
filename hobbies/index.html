      <h3 class="title">Code</h3>
      <p>Although my job is in software, coding is also one of my main hobbies!
My main language is python.
I use it regularly for web development, data analysis, and other bits and bobs.
I like elixir for highly concurrent webapps.
Frontend-wise I will usually go for react / next.js with typescript, or plain old HTML/CSS/JS.
I'm familiar with way too many creative coding languages: max/MSP and Pd, arduino and processing, some unity3d, blender and a bit more.</p>
      <h3 class="title">Music</h3>
      <p>I play an instrument since... forever!
Started with sax and piano as a kid. Picked up bass guitar at 14 and played in a few rock bands since then.
Got into electronic music in 2017 and shortly after started performing improvised modular jams under the alias <em><a href="https://nagasaki45.leverstone.me">nagasaki45</a></em>.
Recently teamed up with <em><a href="https://lwlsn.github.io/digitalselves-web/">digital selves</a></em> to perform together as <em>IDMT?</em></p>
      <h3 class="title">Board games</h3>
      <p>Enjoy playing board games for many years, and got deeper into the hobby ~2018.
Favourite game at the moment is <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155821/inis">Inis</a>.
I play on a weekly basis, so if you're into that drop me a line!</p>
      <h3 class="title">Sports</h3>
      <p>Bouldering regularly at <a href="https://www.mileendwall.org.uk/">Mile End Climbing Wall</a>.
On a good day I might even manage a V5.
Recently got into cycling, and especially bikepacking.
Always try to escape the city on the weekends for a night in the tent and some scenic rides.
There's no such thing as too many hobbies, right?</p>
      <h3 class="title">Crafts</h3>
      <p>Started sewing to make bags for my bike.
Now developing some ambition for larger projects.
Get my saw and chisels out and do some carpentry when I need new furniture.
Also, design and build some simple modules for my synth.
You see, my hobbies feed themselves.</p>
