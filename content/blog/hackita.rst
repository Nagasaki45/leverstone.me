In the last few weeks I was participating in the first session of
"`Hackita <https://hackita.hasadna.org.il/>`__\ ", which means "The
classroom" in Hebrew. This project aims to bring people from different
backgrounds to learn and develop open source web applications together.
Furthermore, the project is part of `The Public Knowledge
Workshop <http://www.hasadna.org.il/en/>`__, and as such one of its main
goals is to guide its participants to complete a project that expose
public knowledge to the public by the end of the 2 month session,
somewhere around late January.
Until now we've learned few technologies that will help us accomplish
this goal and from the next week we will start to work on the final
project.
Meanwhile, here are two of my "homework" exercises:

-  `SimpleCrypt <http://simplecrypt.appspot.com/>`__ - Online
   cryptographic tool, based on
   `DES <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard>`__.
   Source @ `github <https://github.com/Nagasaki45/SimpleCrypt>`__.
-  `Friends-Mapper <http://friends-mapper.herokuapp.com/>`__ - Creates a
   dynamic map of your friends. Source @
   `github <https://github.com/Nagasaki45/Friends-Mapper>`__.

Information regarding my final project will come soon...
