My experiments with the `Web-Audio API`_, creating a collaborative synthesizer for the web.
Using websockets to communicate between browsers, several players can play the keyboard simultaneously.
The project is only a demo, but it clearly demonstrate the possibilities that modern web technologies have to offer for interactive music systems.
