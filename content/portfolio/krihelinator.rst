:summary: "Trendiness of OSS should be assessed by contribution rate, not by stars" - Meir Kriheli

This project proposes an alternative to `github's trending page`_, by exposing projects with high contribution rate, instead of daily stars (similarly to github's pulse page).
The krihelimeter of each repository is calculated using the number of authors, commits, pull requests, and issues of that project, from the past week.

.. _`github's trending page`: https://github.com/trending

Public appearance
-----------------

- In March 2017, Wikipedia added the project to the `list project that measure programming language popularity`_.
- In January 2017 the project was introduced to `hacker news`_, reddit_, and lobsters_, reaching the first page in each of them. This resulted in significant public interest, important feedback, and suggestions for improvements, as well as mentioning in the technology podcast `reversim`_ (in Hebrew).
- In August 2016 I presented the project in PyWeb IL. Here are the video_ of my presentation (in Hebrew) and the slides_.
- In July 2016 `Shai Efrati presented the project in EuroPython lightening talks`_.
