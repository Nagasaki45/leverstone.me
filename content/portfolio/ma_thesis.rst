Abstract:
We explore new possibilities for interactive music consumption by
proposing an audio-only augmented reality system for social interaction.
We designed and built an Android application that measures the relative
position of the device from specially designed Bluetooth beacons.
Participants can freely move the beacons that are installed on physical
objects, thereby dynamically changing the structure of the music in the
virtual space. In a controlled experiment, we assessed the interactive
component of the system in the context of a silent rave party by
comparing the system positioning readings in interactive and
non-interactive control segments. We also directly assessed the user
experience using self-reported pre/post surveys. Our preliminary results
show that in the post-party survey, participants self-reported
significantly higher levels of movement using the system, compared with
their behavior on other parties as reported in the pre-party survey. We
used the relative positioning system in the application to objectively
validate that the interactive components of the system facilitate
greater participant movement in space, thereby offering more frequent
opportunities for social interaction. Indeed, in the post-party survey
participants reported that they danced significantly less with people
that they knew ahead of time, compared with their pre-party survey
reporting of usual behavior. Our results displaying the potential of
using audio-only augmented reality in future mobile applications.

This demo shows how movement of participants in space affects the music they hear through their own Android device and headphones using the system in a silent disco party. In addition it demonstrate the influence of different participants on one another when one virtual participant takes diverse sound zones with him during this simulation. The music is the same as in the original system.
