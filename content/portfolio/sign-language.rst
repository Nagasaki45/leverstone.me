:summary: A gesture to speech application
:links: source code;https://github.com/Nagasaki45/Sign-language;fa-github

A gesture to speech application that uses the `LeapMotion`_ to track gestures, the `WekiMini`_ to analyze the gestures using supervised machine learning algorithms, and a python web server for text to speech conversion and web interface.

The project was originally created in the Hack2Wear hackathon (2014), together with Ilai Giloh and Mel.
