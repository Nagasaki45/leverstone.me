title: In-browser LLM on Chrome Canary

The nightly version of Google Chrome ships with an on-device LLM. The model it runs is [Gemini Nano](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/nano/). Some documentation about this can be found [here](https://github.com/explainers-by-googlers/prompt-api/tree/main).

It's not surprising to be honest, that tiny LLMs make their way into browsers. We have already heard that [Mozilla is experimenting with automatically generating image alt tags with on-device AI]({filename}/Blog/Mozilla-is-experimenting-with-local-alt-text-generation-in-Firefox.md). I'm sure we will see similar initiatives come to fruition in the upcoming months. What I do hope, though, is that some of these improvements will also make their way into web standards. That will probably take a bit more time.
