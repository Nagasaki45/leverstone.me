I've recently submitted my `MA research proposal <https://db.tt/4h5u179a>`__, titled:
"Audio-Only Augmented Reality System for Social Interaction".
Usually, research proposals aims to present the subject and describe
the intents of the current research. This one is a bit more
comprehensive, presenting a fully operated system I've developed,
preliminary results of the system evaluation, and the exact design for a
future experiment.
Feedback is always welcome. LaTeX source can be foundÂ @
`github <https://github.com/Nagasaki45/MA>`__.
