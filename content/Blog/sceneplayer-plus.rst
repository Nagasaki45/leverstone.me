ScenePlayer Plus is an enhanced version of
`ScenePlayer <https://github.com/libpd/pd-for-android/tree/master/ScenePlayer>`__
by Peter Brinkmann.
It uses additional capabilities of the Android device that are not
used by RjDj or ScenePlayer apps (Bluetooth is an example) but it is
still fully compatible with standard RjDj scenes.
ScenePlayer Plus can be downloaded from `Google
Play <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nagasaki45.sceneplayerplus>`__.
Source code can be found at
`Github <https://github.com/Nagasaki45/ScenePlayer-Plus>`__Â and
instruction for creating scenes for ScenePlayer Plus can be found at the
`project wiki <https://github.com/Nagasaki45/ScenePlayer-Plus/wiki>`__.
ScenePlayer Plus has been developed as part of my master thesis as an
implementation of the `proposed
system <{filename}/Projects/ma_thesis.md>`__.
With the abilities of `libpd <http://libpd.cc/>`__ and the ease of use
of ScenePlayer I've found that the only component that is necessary for
me to develop is the Bluetooth discovery routine for the relative indoor
positioning.
Developers that interested in improving the Bluetooth awareness
capabilities of the app or in adding more features (GPS / compass /
social media APIs etc.) are welcome to contact me.
