I'm kickstarting a technical book club! It's going to be based around a mailing list with one thread per week discussing the scope covered that week. I have some ideas for what to read, but happy to get feedback and hear from other interested people.

If this sounds like an interesting idea, join me on [https://groups.io/g/tech-book-club](https://groups.io/g/tech-book-club)
