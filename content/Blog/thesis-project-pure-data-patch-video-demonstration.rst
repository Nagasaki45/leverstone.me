This demo shows how movement of participants in space affects the music
they hear through their own Android device and headphones using the
system in a silent disco party. In addition it demonstrate the influence
of different participants on one another when one virtual participant
takes diverse sound zones with him during this simulation. The music is
the same as in the original system.
