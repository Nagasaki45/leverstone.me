You are welcome to download and install ARpArty scene for
`ScenePlayer Plus <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nagasaki45.sceneplayerplus>`__
from `here <http://db.tt/Y6cn2APx>`__. ARpArty was developed as an
implementation of audio-based augmented reality system for interactive
music consumption in a silent disco context and is the main scene that I
use in my research.
In order to install the scene, just copy the extracted directory from
the zip file to the SD card of your device, then launch the the app and
add the new scene.
If you are an artist that want to develop Bluetooth aware scenes for
ScenePlayer Plus taking a look at this scene could be a good starting
point.
