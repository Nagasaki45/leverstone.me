After more than 4 years online, the Krihelinator was shut down today. The idea behind this project was to propose an alternative to github's trading page by highlighting projects with high contribution rate instead of stars. I'm a bit sorry to let this project go, as it was one of my main side projects for many years. The decision came after multiple changes to some github pages that the project was scraping. After the last change the data that the project collected was so broken that it didn't make much sense to keep it online as is. I decided not to fix it, as I have other side projects that I would like to dedicate more time to at the moment.

More information about the project can be found on `github <https://github.com/nagasaki45/krihelinator>`_.
