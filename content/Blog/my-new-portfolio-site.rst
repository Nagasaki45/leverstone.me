I have a new site!

The site was created to present the different projects I'm working on
as a portfolio. I will keep posting ideas and explorations here. But I
feel that a site with a proper home page and unique design (compared to
this blog, at least) will present the projects and my skillset in a
better light.
And for the technical part. This is a static, pelican based site. The
theme was adapted from the `Hugo Creative
theme <http://themes.gohugo.io/creative/>`__, with several
modifications. Feel free to
`fork <https://github.com/Nagasaki45/leverstone.me>`__ and change for
your own needs.
As usual, comments are more than welcome!
