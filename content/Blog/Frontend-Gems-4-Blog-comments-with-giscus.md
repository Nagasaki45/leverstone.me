title: "Frontend Gems 4: Blog comments with giscus"

I've been wanting to spark more discussion around my blog posts. While sharing them on LinkedIn is great for visibility (especially while [job hunting]({filename}/Blog/I-found-a-new-job.md)), I'm genuinely curious to hear what you think and get your feedback. Somehow, for me, that kind of conversation doesn't always happen on social media.

So, I decided to add a comment section right here on the blog. It's a feature I've wanted for a while, and one I often miss when it's not available on other sites I read.

When I started looking for a comment system, I had a few key requirements:

- I didn't want to host it myself.
- The comments needed to be portable, so I could move them if I switched services.
- It had to be free.
- Ideally, it would use a service I already have, so I wouldn't need another account.

That's a tough list, but [giscus](https://giscus.app/) ticks all the boxes. It's an open-source project that uses GitHub discussions as a backend for a comment section on your site. It was very easy to integrate into this blog, so why not write a Frontend Gems post about it?!? ðŸ¤©

The main downside is that you need a GitHub account to comment. There are no anonymous posts or other login options. Given this blog's technical focus and audience, I think that's a trade-off I can live with.

So, please give it a try! I'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below. ðŸ˜Š
