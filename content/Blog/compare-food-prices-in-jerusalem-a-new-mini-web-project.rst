Two things happened recently, I've moved to the holly city and started
to learn Python. Here are the consequences: a mini web app to compare
food prices, written in Django and deployed to pythonanywhere, for my
own purpose and for my students friends.

More features will be added soon and on demand :-). If you want to be
able to update markets, products and prices, drop a comment and I will
create an account for you.
And as always, source code can be found at
`github <https://github.com/Nagasaki45/MarketPrices>`__.
