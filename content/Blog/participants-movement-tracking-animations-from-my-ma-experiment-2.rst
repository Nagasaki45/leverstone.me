The following animated renditions are a byproduct of the video

The figure above shows a schematic diagram of the experiment design.
The videos are of session 1 to 3 of each of the groups (the last session
wasn't analyzed). They have been for great help in gaining insights
about the social interactions between the participants themselves and
between the participants and the system components.
