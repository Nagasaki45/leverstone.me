I play an instrument since... forever!
Started with sax and piano as a kid. Picked up bass guitar at 14 and played in a few rock bands since then.
Got into electronic music in 2017 and shortly after started performing improvised modular jams under the alias *[nagasaki45](https://nagasaki45.leverstone.me)*.
Recently teamed up with *[digital selves](https://lwlsn.github.io/digitalselves-web/)* to perform together as *IDMT?*
