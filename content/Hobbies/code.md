Although my job is in software, coding is also one of my main hobbies!
My main language is python.
I use it regularly for web development, data analysis, and other bits and bobs.
I like elixir for highly concurrent webapps.
Frontend-wise I will usually go for react / next.js with typescript, or plain old HTML/CSS/JS.
I'm familiar with way too many creative coding languages: max/MSP and Pd, arduino and processing, some unity3d, blender and a bit more.
