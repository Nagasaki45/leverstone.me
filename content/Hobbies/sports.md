Bouldering regularly at [Mile End Climbing Wall](https://www.mileendwall.org.uk/).
On a good day I might even manage a V5.
Recently got into cycling, and especially bikepacking.
Always try to escape the city on the weekends for a night in the tent and some scenic rides.
There's no such thing as too many hobbies, right?
