A controller for full-body interactive performances that requires
applying force and effort to play with, hopefully facilitating
expressiveness. It is composed of two elastic bands that are attached to
the players' belt loops, and a main unit that measures the tension on
each elastic band. The player holds the other side of each elastic band
and stretches them to play. The controller is demonstrated using a
generative drum machine by mapping the stretch of the bands to tempo and
the pitch of the samples.
