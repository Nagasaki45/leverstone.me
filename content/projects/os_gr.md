The Ordnance Survey grid reference is a British system to denote
geographic locations, similar to latitude and longitude. It is commonly
used in maps and guides for navigation. Many android apps, however,
don't work natively with OS grid references. This is where the [OS GR
android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.os_gr)
comes in.

You can open a location from a different app with it, and it will tell
you the OS GR, or you can type one in and open it in a different app.
There are many apps that can tell you the GR of your location, based on
GPS, but IMHO it is more useful to be able to point at a location on a
map and ask for the GR. Annoyingly, not all maps / navigation apps
support opening a location in a different app (i.e. google maps and
komoot), so you cannot get the GR from these. You can still type in a GR
and open it in komoot for example.

## Wanna help?

-   I have an android device, hence why it's an android app. It should
    be relatively easy to build an iOS app from the same source code.
-   If you're willing to contribute a better logo than the horrendous
    thing I've designed that will be great.
-   Any comments, feature requests (within reason), please do tell.

Get in touch either by email or on the [project's repo on
github](https://github.com/Nagasaki45/OS_GR).

## Disclaimer

**I'm not a professional mobile developer, and it's just a free and
open source mini project of mine. It probably won't light your phone on
fire, or share your bank details with facebook, but it might (and
probably will) brake in unexpected ways. Please don't blindly rely on
this for navigation.**
