bibo is a command line reference manager with a single source of truth:
the .bib file. It is inspired by [beets](https://beets.readthedocs.io/).

-   It gives you control over your files. They are not hidden in some
    obscure database, hence easy to backup, share, etc.
-   It's a thin editor of .bib files, so no need to export your
    bibliography anywhere.
-   It's extensible with plugins.
-   It's a command line tool. What not to ❤️?
