This project proposes an alternative to [github's trending
page](https://github.com/trending), by exposing projects with high
contribution rate, instead of daily stars (similarly to github's pulse
page). The krihelimeter of each repository is calculated using the
number of authors, commits, pull requests, and issues of that project,
from the past week.

## Public appearance

-   In March 2017, Wikipedia added the project to the [list project that
    measure programming language
    popularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_programming_language_popularity).
-   In January 2017 the project was introduced to [hacker
    news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13450554),
    [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/5pcylf/this_project_proposes_an_alternative_to_githubs/),
    and
    [lobsters](https://lobste.rs/s/nlghvo/krihelinator_github_trending),
    reaching the first page in each of them. This resulted in
    significant public interest, important feedback, and suggestions for
    improvements, as well as mentioning in the technology podcast
    [reversim](http://www.reversim.com/2017/02/315-bumpers-36.html) (in
    Hebrew).
-   In August 2016 I presented the project in PyWeb IL. Here are the
    [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03c_yQZKopY) of my
    presentation (in Hebrew) and the
    [slides](https://rawgit.com/Nagasaki45/pyweb-talk/master/index.html).
-   In July 2016 [Shai Efrati presented the project in EuroPython
    lightening talks](https://youtu.be/99hirARuiyY?t=31m53s).
