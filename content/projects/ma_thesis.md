**Abstract:** Music plays a crucial role in social interactions. This
thesis examines how an interactive environment might facilitate such
exchanges by developing and evaluating a novel system for joint music
consumption by a group of users in the same place and time. The system
provides a platform for the creation of spatial interactive music. It
uses relative locations measured using a Bluetooth signal, and generates
an immersive personalized augmented musical environment that depends on
the location of its participants. I conducted two experiments testing
the system within the context of a silent disco party, using the
system's relative position signals as well as video tracking to
evaluate the experience of users with and without prior acquaintance.
The results showed that for both groups, the system promoted openness
and increased the social interaction between users.

## Publications

In addition to the thesis I published an extended abstract in the
proceedings of [HCI International 2013](http://hcii2013.org/), and
presented a [poster](/pdfs/HCI2013%20poster.pdf) in the conference
posters session:

[here](/pdfs/Gurion%20and%20Jacoby%20-%20Audio-Only%20Augmented%20Reality%20System%20for%20Social%20Interaction.pdf).

I also gave an [oral
presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/Nagasaki45/audioonly-augmented-reality-system-for-social-interaction)
of my research at [ISTAS'13](http://sites.ieee.org/istas-2013/).

## Video demonstration of the Pure Data patch

This demo shows how movement of participants in space affects the music
they hear through their own Android device and headphones using the
system in a silent disco party. In addition it demonstrate the influence
of different participants on one another when one virtual participant
takes diverse sound zones with him during this simulation. The music is
the same as in the original system.
