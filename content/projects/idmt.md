nagasaki45 is my electronic music stage name. I improvise live sets
focusing on percussive, up-beat, and polymetric structures on a modular
synth.

## IDMT?

Lizzie Wilson, AKA [digital
selves](https://lwlsn.github.io/digitalselves-web/), is a London based
audiovisual artist who likes to use computer code to make sounds and
visuals and occasionally both. Together we play under the IDMT? alias.
