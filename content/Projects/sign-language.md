A gesture to speech application that uses the
[LeapMotion](http://www.leapmotion.com/) to track gestures, the
[WekiMini](http://www.wekinator.org/) to analyze the gestures using
supervised machine learning algorithms, and a python web server for text
to speech conversion and web interface.

The project was originally created in the Hack2Wear hackathon (2014),
together with Ilai Giloh and Mel.
