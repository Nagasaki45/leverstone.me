I'm running a technical book club, over a mailing list. üìö‚úâÔ∏è

It's aimed at software engineers who want to improve their technical skills by reading and discussing what they read with a small, friendly, and easy to navigate community. It runs completely online, in the form of a mailing list. Every week there will be a thread to discuss the content we covered that week. There are no in-person aspect to this book club, and all communication is completely asynchronous. We will focus on one book at a time, and try to go through it over a few months. When we start a new book the agenda for the next few months will be published on the mailing list. Come join us!
