A CruftFest 2016 project / an assignment to the Interactive Digital
Multimedia Techniques (ESC742P) module, Media and Arts Technology, Queen
Mary University of London.

This project uses modified audio cassettes as controllers for an
interactive and collaborative musical interface. It invites users to
manually turn the cassettes wheels, with their pinky or a BIC® pen, to
control the speed of the music. The interaction is simple and
intuitive - the higher the speed of the wheel, the faster the music.
Multiple cassettes enable a group of users to play together, letting
each one to control different track in the music. The resulted sounds
fluctuate in speed and in pitch, and therefore cannot be synchronized.
The lack of synchronization, which is unusual in familiar music, suggest
different types of interactions with the musical materials and between
players.
