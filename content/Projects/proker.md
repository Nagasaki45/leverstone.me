Developers have many things to vote on:

- What to eat for lunch
- Favourite colour scheme for the new website
- Estimated complexity of user stories

You can use Proker for any of these, but it's mostly made to help with the last point.

I've made this project for two reasons. First, I wanted to play a bit more with [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/welcome.html) - an extension for the Elixir web framework Phoenix that provides SPA-like experience without writing any frontend code. Second, my team hated the web app we used to vote on user stories because rooms didn't work well (people dropping out and back in) and it was just very buggy. Proker has been serving us very well over the past 3 years.
