My experiments with the [Web-Audio
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API),
creating a collaborative synthesizer for the web. Using websockets to
communicate between browsers, several players can play the keyboard
simultaneously. The project is only a demo, but it clearly demonstrate
the possibilities that modern web technologies have to offer for
interactive music systems.
